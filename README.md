Rails 4.0.0

Lighthouse Forum
Welcome to our introduction to Rails!

We're going to build a simple open forum app that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Destroy posts. Those words should sound familiar. CRUD is a central tenet to building relational database-backed applications (the kind Rails is great at!), so this tutorial should provide some great building blocks to use in the web apps you'll be building for the next few weeks and months and years. Very exciting.
